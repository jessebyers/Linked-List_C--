//LinkedListDemo - Main Program
/******************************/
//Author: Alex Mendes
//Course: SENG1120
//Program Description: This program demonstrates the basic functionality of a linked list that stores text. 
//It will demo the functions of a linked list which stores general text, one token in each node.
//The program adds content to a linked list, removes individual nodes, counts the number of words, and concatenates sentences.
//Finally, a more advanced feature is text reversal, which reserves the order of the words in a sentence.
